# Node.js: Professional README Generator

With this app you can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

The application will be invoked by using the following command from inside the Develop folder:

```
node index.js
```

Because this application isn't deployed, I am attachign a walktrough video and some screenshots:
